# Voice &amp; Tone

Before you write for Nine Labs, it’s important to think about our readers. While we need to be clear about who we are, what we do, and how we do it; we must keep the focus on the reader's perspective and needs. We should write as though we're speaking directly to the reader, one-on-one in casual conversation.

### Our Brand Voice

- Authoritative but not elitist.
- Confident yet playful.
- Professional yet casual.

#### We Are:

- curious
- contemplative
- helpful
- passionate
- fair
- architects and engineers, not plumbers and carpenters

#### We Are Not (words we would never use):

- reserved
- selfish
- "we make websites"
- developers (we don't write code)
- out to make a buck


### Guidelines for Writing

Whether it's an email to a client or an article to be published on our website, we want our writing to be clear and consistent.

**Ask yourself:**
- What am I trying to say?
- What words will express it to someone who isn't technical?
- What image or idiom will make it clearer?
- Is this image or idiom fresh (recent and relevant) enough to have the desired effect?


We generally subscribe to the [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html) and [Orwell's Rules](https://www.writingclasses.com/toolbox/tips-masters/george-orwell-6-questions-6-rules) for all our content, and have added a few of our own to further guide you in your writing.

1. Never use a long word where a short one will do.
1. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
1. Never use the passive where you can use the active.
1. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
1. Never start a paragraph with "We". Our focus should be on the reader, not ourselves. Starting with "We" makes it about us.
1. Use definite, specific, concrete language.
1. Keep your exclamation points under control!!!
1. If it sounds like writing, rewrite it.
1. Break any of these rules if it makes the reader happy or makes the message better.

#### Keep it Simple
Avoid using industry or project specific acronyms wherever possible. It might feel like extra words to spell things out, but it's necessary. The people who know the acronyms will glide right past the full phrase, while the people who don't will get stuck on the acronym and it will impair their ability to follow along.

Contractions, idioms, slang, and pop-culture references are totally okay &mdash; so long as doing so is consistent with our voice and  won't distract from making the point. _We're all cool with saying "y'all" if it helps get the message across. Ya dig?_

#### The Oxford Comma
Commas save lives. Consider: "Let's eat, Grandma!" vs "Let's eat Grandma!". The Oxford Comma is the difference between having a breakfast of eggs, toast, and orange juice - and a breakfast of eggs, toast and orange juice. You get the point.

### Formatting

#### Headings
Headings should be less than 12 words, and should always be in Title Case.

  _(e.g. "Why Now Is the Best Time to Invest in New Technology")_


#### Paragraphs
Paragraphs should be as short as possible and easy to scan in the page. Typically each paragraph should be between 30 and 100 words.

#### Quotes

We always use Smart Quotes in our writing.

- &quot;This isn&apos;t right&quot;
- &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better!&rdquo;
