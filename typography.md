Approved fonts and type styles for usage in Nine Labs digital products.

## Headings

Headings use <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans">Fira Sans</a> and range from *72px* for `h1` to *18px* for `h6`. Note that the `h4` and `h5` headings are the same *font-size*, but different styles. The `h4` heading is set to uppercase using `text-transform: uppercase` and is set to be the Brand Pink color, while the `h5` heading follows the pattern and style from the other headings. This is so we can easily create the emphasis we want in various circumstances.

<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>


```html
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>
```

### Typical Page Heading

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col my-5">
      <div class="highlight-bar"></div>
      <h1>This is the headline</h1>
      <p>This is an optional line of text that compliments the heading.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col my-5">
      <div class="highlight-bar"></div>
      <h1>This is the headline</h1>
      <p>This is an optional line of text that compliments the heading.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### The Highlight Bar

When headings `h1`, `h2`, or `h3` are used at the top of a page or the beginning of a new section of content you should include the Highlight Bar above the `hx` element. The bar automatically resizes to 18% of the heading's container width, with a minimum width of 90px.

*Note: The Highlight Bar is not to be used with `h4`, `h5`, or `h6` level headings.*

<div class="highlight-bar"></div>
<h2>This is the Title of a Content Section</h2>

```html
<div class="highlight-bar"></div>
<h2>This is a Title</h2>
```

## Body Copy

All other text is set in <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather">Merriweather</a> at *18px* with a `line-height` of *1.5rem*.

### Quotes

We use “smart” (curly) quotes, instead of "dumb" (straight) quotes. “Smart” quotes improve readability by making it obvious where the quote begins and ends - "dumb" quotes do not. Be smart with ‘single’ and “double” quotes.

**Avoid**

- 'single'
- "double"

**Use**

- ‘single’
- “double”
